# mhr-analysis
This program is a simple script that automates the process of validating a hash (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) and querying the Malware Hash Registry (MHR) to check if the hash is known to be malicious. It fetches the information from the MHR API and prints the timestamp and AV (Antivirus) hit rate for each malicious hash found into a CSV file.
